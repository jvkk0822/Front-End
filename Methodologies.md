Extreme Programming: 
=============================
	XP requires an extended development team. The XP team includes not only the developers, but the managers and customers as well, all working together (elbow to elbow). Asking questions, negotiating scope and schedules, and creating functional tests require more than just the developers be involved in producing the software. XP is set up for small groups of programmers, Between 2 and 12.
	The five values of XP are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect. 
Another requirement is testability. You must be able to create automated unit and functional tests. While some domains will be disqualified by this requirement, you may be surprised how many are not. You do need to apply a little testing ingenuity in some domains. You may need to change your system design to be easier to test.
	The last thing on the list is productivity.  The real goal has always been to deliver the software that is needed when it is needed. 

Pair Programming: 
=============================
	All code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer. Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. The best pair programmers know when to say "let's try your idea first." It helps if you have someone on your team with experience to show everyone what it should feel like. One thing pair programming is not is mentoring. Eg: teacher-student relationship.

Test Driven Development (TDD): 
=============================
	TDD is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring. Primary view is the goal to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code. Another view is that TDD is a programming technique; the goal of TDD is to write clean code that works.
